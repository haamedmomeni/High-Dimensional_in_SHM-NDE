# Robust Principal Component Analysis
This repository contains a Python 3.0 notebook to establish RPCA to monitor surface cracks from a video.
Consider that, an grayscale image should be first converted to numerical matrix and saved as .csv file (image.csv).
For video, the grayscale frames of video are first converted to 2D matrix. Then, these 2D matrices are flatten to create a vector. The time sewunce of these vecotor-shaped frame make the input of RPCA in format of .csv file (data.csv).
