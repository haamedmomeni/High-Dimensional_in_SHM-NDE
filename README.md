# High-dimensional Data Analytics in Structural Health Monitoring and Non-Destructive Evaluation
This repository contains several Structural Health Monitoring and Non-Destructive Evaluation datasets and codes of High-dimensional Data Analytics.
The method used in this repositary are:
1. Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)
2. Compressive Sensing (CS)
3. Matrix Completion (MC)
4. Tensor-based data analysis (TDA)
5. Robust Principal Component Analysis (RPCA)
6. Functional Data Analysis (FPCA)
